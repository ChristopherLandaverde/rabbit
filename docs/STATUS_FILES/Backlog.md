# Development Backlog

## Current Sprint: Testing Infrastructure

### High Priority (This Week)
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration and test runner
- [ ] Create test fixtures for sample data files
- [ ] Implement ground truth datasets for validation
- [ ] Write algorithm correctness tests for linear attribution
- [ ] Add CSV parsing tests with edge cases

### Medium Priority (Next Week)
- [ ] Complete all attribution model tests
- [ ] Add file processing error handling tests
- [ ] Implement API endpoint contract tests
- [ ] Create performance benchmark tests
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting

### Low Priority (Future Sprints)
- [ ] Load testing with large datasets
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility tests
- [ ] Documentation accuracy validation
- [ ] Integration test automation

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Refactor data validation error messages
- [ ] Optimize memory usage in file processing
- [ ] Add type hints to legacy utility functions
- [ ] Improve error logging granularity
