# Frontend Quick Start

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: Create Frontend from Scratch (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/oppie/Desktop/rabbit

# Create frontend directory
mkdir frontend
cd frontend

# Initialize React + TypeScript project with Vite
npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install UI library and charts
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install recharts axios react-query
npm install react-router-dom react-hook-form
```

### Option 2: Use a Template
I can create a complete frontend boilerplate with:
- All necessary dependencies
- API integration setup
- Basic routing structure
- Component placeholders
- Type definitions for your API

Would you like me to create the frontend boilerplate now?

### Option 3: Start with Simple Static HTML
Begin with a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype to validate the UX before building the full React app.

## Your Decision
Choose one:
1. **Create full React frontend** - Production-ready setup with all components
2. **Create basic HTML prototype** - Quick proof of concept
3. **Continue planning** - Refine the requirements first

Let me know what you'd like to do!
