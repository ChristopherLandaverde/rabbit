What This Project Does
The Multi-Touch Attribution API solves a critical challenge for marketing teams: understanding which channels and touchpoints actually drive conversions. Instead of relying on simple last-click attribution, this API provides:

Sophisticated Attribution Models: Five different approaches including linear, time-decay, and position-based attribution
Smart Identity Resolution: Automatically links customer touchpoints across devices and sessions
Confidence Scoring: Every result includes reliability metrics so you know when to trust the data
Universal Data Support: Works with CSV, JSON, and Parquet files from any marketing platform

Key Capabilities
Data Processing Pipeline

Validation & Schema Detection - Automatically detects data structure and validates format
Identity Resolution - Links touchpoints into customer journeys using optimal method
Attribution Modeling - Applies selected attribution model with confidence scoring
Insights Generation - Provides actionable business recommendations

Attribution Models

Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
First-Touch: 100% credit to awareness channels
Last-Touch: 100% credit to conversion channels
Time-Decay: More credit to recent interactions
Position-Based: Emphasizes first and last touchpoints (40/20/40 split)

Identity Resolution Methods

Customer ID: Highest accuracy when unique IDs available
Session + Email: Cross-session tracking for logged-in users
Email Only: Cross-device attribution via email matching
Statistical: Probabilistic matching when identifiers unavailable
Auto: Intelligent selection based on data quality

Getting Started
For Developers

Read the specifications: Start with docs/api/SPECIFICATION.md for the complete API contract
Understand the architecture: Review docs/technical/ARCHITECTURE.md for system design
Follow implementation guide: Use docs/development/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md to build
Check development rules: See docs/development/CONTEXT_RULES.md for coding standards

For Product Teams

Review requirements: See docs/business/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md for complete feature list
Understand use cases: Check target user scenarios and success metrics
Test planning: Review docs/technical/TESTING_STRATEGY.md for quality assurance

For API Users

Integration guide: Follow docs/development/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for usage examples
Data requirements: Ensure your data includes required fields (timestamp, channel, event_type)
Model selection: Choose attribution model based on your business needs

Example Usage
python# Validate your marketing data
validation = api.validate_data("marketing_touchpoints.csv")

# Run attribution analysis
results = api.analyze_attribution(
    file="marketing_touchpoints.csv",
    model="linear",
    attribution_window=30
)

# Extract insights
for channel, attribution in results['channel_attribution'].items():
    print(f"{channel}: {attribution['credit']:.1%} credit")
Technical Requirements

File Formats: CSV, JSON, Parquet (up to 100MB)
Required Fields: timestamp, channel, event_type
Optional Fields: customer_id, email, revenue, campaign
Processing Time: <5 minutes for 100MB files
API Response: JSON with confidence scoring

## Testing & Status Tracking Guidelines

### Testing Structure
- Follow the testing strategy outlined in TESTING_STATUS.md
- Organize tests by category: unit/, integration/, performance/
- Create ground truth datasets for algorithm validation
- Maintain 85%+ test coverage target
- Use pytest with async support for all testing

### Status Tracking Integration
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md when completing major milestones
- Use status tracking scripts to automate progress updates
- Maintain visual progress indicators in documentation
- Track testing progress separately from development progress

### Test-Driven Development for Attribution Logic
- Write algorithm tests first for all attribution models
- Validate mathematical accuracy within 0.001 precision
- Test edge cases (single touchpoint, empty journeys, etc.)
- Include performance benchmarks for large datasets

### File Organization for Testing
tests/
├── fixtures/sample_data/     # Test data files
├── unit/                     # Algorithm & logic tests
├── integration/             # End-to-end API tests
├── performance/             # Load & benchmark tests
└── data/                    # Test data generators

### Testing Priority Order
1. Algorithm correctness (attribution models, identity resolution)
2. Data processing (file parsing, validation, schema detection)
3. API contracts (endpoints, error handling, responses)
4. Integration workflows (complete file-to-results flows)
5. Performance & reliability (load testing, memory usage)

### Testing Code Patterns

#### Algorithm Test Structure:
```python
class TestLinearAttributionModel:
    def test_credit_distribution_sums_to_one(self):
        """Verify attribution credits always sum to exactly 1.0"""
        journey = create_test_journey(['google_ads', 'email', 'direct'])
        model = LinearAttributionModel()
        credits = model.calculate_attribution(journey)
        assert abs(sum(credits.values()) - 1.0) < 1e-10

        @pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_analyze_attribution_success(client: AsyncClient, sample_csv_file):
    """Test successful attribution analysis."""
    response = await client.post(
        "/attribution/analyze",
        files={"file": ("test.csv", sample_csv_file, "text/csv")},
        data={"model": "linear", "attribution_window": 30}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200

def test_processing_time_benchmarks(benchmark):
    """Benchmark processing times for different file sizes."""
    large_data = create_test_dataset(rows=100000)
    result = benchmark(process_attribution_data, large_data, 'linear')
    assert result.processing_time < 30.0  # 30 seconds max
    # Validate response structure matches OpenAPI spec

This project provides a complete foundation for building a production-ready attribution API that delivers reliable, confidence-scored marketing insights.
